## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined using Prisma and includes the following entities:

*   **User**: Represents users of the application. Stores profile information, authentication details, and associations with other entities like posts, comments, communities, etc.
*   **Campus**: Represents physical university campuses.
*   **Faculty**: Represents academic faculties within the university.
*   **Course**: Represents academic courses offered by faculties.
*   **Unit**: Represents individual units of study within courses or faculties.
*   **Community**: Represents user-created communities. These can be general or linked to specific campuses, faculties, courses, or units.
*   **Post**: Represents posts made by users within communities. Posts can be text, images, links, or videos.
*   **Comment**: Represents comments made by users on posts. Comments can be nested.
*   **Vote**: Represents upvotes or downvotes on posts or comments by users.
*   **CommunityMembership**: Manages users' membership status and roles (member, moderator, admin) within communities.
*   **Moderator**: Defines users who have moderation privileges within specific communities.
*   **UserUnitEnrollment**: Tracks user enrollment in specific units, including year, semester, and status.
*   **SavedContent**: Allows users to save posts or comments for later viewing.
*   **Notification**: Stores notifications for users related to various events like new comments, post replies, mentions, upvotes, community invites, etc.

The schema utilizes CUIDs for primary keys and includes various enums to define types for entities like `CommunityType`, `PostContentType`, `VoteType`, etc. Indexes are defined on frequently queried fields and foreign keys to optimize database performance.
